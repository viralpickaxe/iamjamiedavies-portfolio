                <h4>pollr. ask awesomly.</h4>
                <p>pollr was a little idea that I threw together on the weekend because I wanted to learn/use node.js, socket.io and mongoDB.</p>
                <p>pollr is a very simple website, when you land on the website you are prompted to enter a question that you want to ask people. Once you do this, you are redirected to another page with your question and two buttons, yes and no. You can then share that link and when people vote either yes or no to your question, you will see the buttons flash and the counters increase.</p>
                <p class="whatidid">This is a hack, it is in no way a finished product.</p>

                <h4>Visualise what leads to your aims in just 2 steps. A project by <a href="http://causehub.io" target=_blank>CauseHub.io</a></h4>
                <p>whatleads.to makes working together to make real change simple. It lets you visualise your aims and how you're going to achieve them really quickly. It's derived from the idea of a Theory of Change, which is a process where you define what your ultimate aim and then work backwards, setting out goals that will lead to it.</p>
                <p>It makes visualising your aims a breeze. By asking "What leads to this?" again and again, you build up a map of all your activities without having to draw it out yourself. Then, you can edit any step and share it with your team or anyone else.</p>
                <p class="whatidid">On this project I am in charge of programming the backend. In this case the backend is a REST API writtern in PHP. I also write a lot of the frontend code to both fetch data from the API and also to generate the visualisations.</p>

                <h2>Relations Tracker<span class="type blue">Hackathon Project</span></h2>
                <h4>Visualing the UKs relationship with other countries through data sources provided by the FCO. A winning hack @ <a href="http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/fcohack" target=_blank>FCOHack 2014</a></h4>
                <p>This project was conceived at the Rewired State Foreign Commonwealth Hack in 2014. This is an API for tracking and qualifying several variables relating to the UK's Diplomatic Relationships. The data is colour coded onto a map giving a visual scale for reflecting the overall strength of the country's relationship with the UK, relative to all other countries. You can select different datasets to include for consideration.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the data that was given to us was very poorly formatted. There were many inconsistencies with basic things like what countries were called. This made it pretty hard to generate a good score. After the hackathon I then went on and blogged about the experience in a post titled, <a href="https://medium.com/words-by-causehub-io/making-data-useful-2851ac7a9335" target=_blank>Making Data Useful</a>.</p>
                <p>However, the concept was proven and we won the prize for the <a href="http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/fcohack/relations-tracker" target=_blank>Best App showing the value of diplomacy</a>!</p>
                <p class="whatidid">I built the API that scraped data from data.gov.uk and the FCO's data sources. It then returned this data to the frontend so that it could be easily inserted into the map.</p>
