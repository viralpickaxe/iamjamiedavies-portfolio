Doorpass was a side project built to be the safest way to manage your teamâ€™s access to their cloud services. It did this by connecting with 3rd party SASS platforms such as GitHub, AWS and Mixpanel. It then provided a standard interface to invite users, assign their permissions and also remove them in one click when the time comes. It was built on-top of a microservice driven platform writtern in Typescript.
