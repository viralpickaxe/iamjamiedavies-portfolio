Over COVID lockdown I designed a built a highly realistic Air Traffic Control simulation game using Typescript and Canvas.

The game is built on-top of a highly performant Canvas Game Engine I designed, and has numerous features such as a command interpreter, predictive completion and aircraft that simulate real world procedures such as ILS approaches and VOR holds.
