Connect was a service that connected people with accredited therapists instantly whenever they needed to talk.

On the frontend was a simple React SPA, and the backend was a REST API is writtern in Node.js, using MondoDB, Socket.io and Redis. I also implemented Elastic Search for quick searching through old conversations. Billing powered by the Stripe API.
