One of the larger projects I worked on at TalkLife. This is the overview and admin dashboard for all TalkLife services. The system needed to be very flexible as it plugs into a bunch of different services (such as Connect and Moderation). As well as this I also built a bunch of cool modules, such as a visualization to display live trending topics across the community.

Another cool one was the feed module, it ran posts through a [ML classifier](https://talklife.co/research) built by MIT that would automatically flag posts contain symptoms of suicidal planning, hateful speech, etc.
