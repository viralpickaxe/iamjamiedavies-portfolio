- Built and maintained a large microservices based web application with a fast single page web application frontend. All written in TypeScript using Node.js and React.
- Worked with hundreds of different APIs for different platforms to build platform integrations.
- When APIs weren't available I had to reverse engineer 3rd party platforms and build complex Web Bots to implement the features that we required.
- Worked with complex crypto algorithms including Shamar Secret Sharing to ensure users data was secure from both external and internal threats.
